Protobuf Definitions
====================
Central repository for all protobuf definitions.

Structure
---------
Each service has a separate directory.

Usage
-----
Auto-generated code is generated by build pipelines when a proto is updated. Projects import auto-generated code as a library. This is the cleanest solution for managing protos across separate projects/languages, but we're open to suggestions!
